‚ö†Ô∏è Why the Datasets Are Not Included in This Repository

Due to GitHub‚Äôs file size limitations (100 MB per file) and storage best practices:

The Enron dataset (~423 MB) and Phishing dataset (~60 MB) are too large to upload directly to GitHub.

GitHub is intended for source code, not large datasets.

To keep the repository lightweight and recruiter-friendly, only trained models and sample/demo CSVs are included here.

üëâ If you want to retrain the model yourself, please download the datasets directly from Kaggle via the links above.
